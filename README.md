This is the code for the how to Do Linear Regression 


## Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship. 



## Dependencies

* numpy

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

Just run ``python3 demo.py`` to see the results:

   ```
Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
   ```
